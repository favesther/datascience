Folder Structure
●	Main structure
project/
├── input/
├── ref/
├── result/
├── work/
└── script.ipynb

●	Explanation
1.	Have the python script files that do things in the project root. 
2.	[input/]: Contains the original, or raw, data files. Contents in this folder should be treated as read-only.
3.	[ref/]: Contains reference files, i.e. from research.
4.	[result/]: Contains the final results and explanatory markdown files.
5.	[work/]: The working directory, from my SAS days, was used to store temporary data files. I like having the main console code directly in the project folder outside of the sub-folders, and storing intermediate data that I may want to reference later in the work sub-folder.

●	Rules for naming script files
1.	1_dataPrepare_[what]_[when]_[other comment].ipynb
example: 1_dataPrepare_review_2018_test.ipynb
2.	2_featureExtract_[what]_[when]_[other comment].ipynb
example: 2_featureExtract_user_2018_test.ipynb
3.	3_model_[what]_[when]_[other comment].ipynb
example: 3_model_xgBoost_2018.ipynb
4.	4_interprete_[what]_[when]_[other comment].ipynb
example: 4_interprete_accuracy.ipynb
