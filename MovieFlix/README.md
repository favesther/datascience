# Movie Recommendation Engine
## Abstract
In recent years, we have seen major companies in the technology, media, and telecom (TMT) sector using recommendation engines to improve customer experience. Recommendation systems have the potential to change the way websites communicate with users and to allow companies to maximize their ROI based on the information they can gather on each customer’s preferences and purchases. According to an article “The Netflix Recommender System: Algorithms, Business Value, and Innovation” written by Netflix executives Carlos A. Gomez-Uribe and Neil Hunt, the video streaming service’s AI recommendation system saves the company around $1 billion each year. This allows them to invest more money on new content which viewers will continue to view, giving them a good ROI.

## Background & Motivation
Movies dominate the social media discussions on most platforms and have a big impact on people. It is important to understand how people react to these movies and what drives them to decide their favorite movies. It is important to provide enhanced entertainment media to users based on their preferences. Recommendation systems can allow us to do that and this technology is behind the major successes of most platforms which involve media.
A movie recommendation system can suggest users a set of movies based on their preferences, behavior towards other movies, movie information like popularity. These metrics about movies are very important to the media and it is important to make the best use of these to enhance user experience while using these media platforms. This can also drive customer loyalty and user engagement. Our recommendation system will help millions of users on social media platforms to narrow down their list of movies to fit their tastes. It’ll help them lessen their use of cognitive abilities while browsing through different movies.

## Project Goals
For the purpose of our project and to harness the true power of cloud computing and machine learning models, we will combine & consolidate movie information from disparate sources to generate recommendations for users. The goal of the this project is to:
1. Build an interactive Web App to browse and view media content & its related information
2. Deploy a recommendation system engine using Microsoft Azure ML for content personalization

To judge the success of the project, we will use the following measures:
* Ease of use of the web application
* Accuracy of the model on validation data
* Accuracy of the model on new, unseen data by taking feedback from users
* Extent of integration of relevant cloud computing services from Microsoft Azure
* Maintainability & scalability of the application developed

## Implementation Technology
For the project, we will make use of the following technologies:
* Azure Cloud Services
	* Azure Blob Storage
	* Azure Machine Learning
	* Azure Container Instances
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook 	

As we have not explored the breadth of Azure services yet, these technologies are suggestions based on our current understanding and are bound to be updated as required to meet the goals of the project.
